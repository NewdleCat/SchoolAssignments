I discussed the search and heuristic algorithm with the group:
		Zachary Booth, Joseph Silberman, Nathan Ma

The search if very similar to a regular A* search, where is takes the cost of the
item to craft and uses that as a priority in the priority queue. uses the graph() function
to check for all the possible recipies given the current state. However, the heuristic is how
the program prioritizes recipies. For instance, if I have an iron pickaxe, itll prioritize all the recipies with an iron pickaxe, meaning I will not get recipies that look for sticks any longer as they are not needed.
