1) nqueens.cpp
    - Code is a modified version of an assignment from CSE 15 with
      professor Patrick Tantalo. The assignment was also nqueens but using recursion
      the code is modified to use stacks instead of recursion and most functions
      were also modified to work better with the structure of the new code

    - placeQueen and removeQueen updated to mark unsafe spots above the queen
    - findSolutions changed to work with stacks instead of recursion
