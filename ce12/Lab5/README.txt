What was your design approach?
First was to get the array size and the find_max subroutines working. Then I started to follow the diagram that
was given to us in order to make make_bet work properly. After that everything sort of just flowed together. 
With a little work and a bunch of debugging the program was finished.

What did you learn in this lab?
I learnt how to create and use subroutines throughout a large program.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enojoyable.
I encountered many issues in the beginning because I wasn't sure where to start. I had to restart and stare at the
flow chart that was given to use for anything to make sense. Sadly, I didn't enjoy this lab very much because I
personally do not enjoy working with other peoples code and would have prefered to make the whole thing
myself from scratch.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Make it easier to understand what we were supposed to do. And perhaps give hints into how we were supposed to start
the lab. Because in general the lab wasn't very hard, it was just hard to grasp the idea of using subroutines.
For instance maybe mention that the flow chart that was given to us was essential to finishing the lab.
I didn't know this until I read a post on piazza telling me that it was really helpful.

What resources did you use to complete this lab?
I watched a few online videos to figure out how subroutines and the stack pointed worked.

Did you work with anyone on the lab? Describe the level of collaboration.
I didnt work with anyone when doing this lab
