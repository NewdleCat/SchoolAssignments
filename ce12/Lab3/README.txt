Lab 3: MIPS!
CMPE 012 Spring 2019

Tee, Nicholas

-------------------------
The text of your prompts are stored in the processor’s memory. After
assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings
are stored?
from 0x10010000 to 0x10010020 + 14 . so from adresses 0 to 34

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
An introduction to how to code in assemply language using the MIPS instruction set
and the MARS IDE

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
I found it quite enjoyable as I had to learn a new programming language, which is something that
I haven't done in awhile. There weren't many issues other than the issues that anyone would have when
trying to learn a new language from scratch such as figuring out the syntax and how everything should be structured

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think that the lab was a good introduction to MARS and MIPS. However, I think that the readings can be
slimmed down to specific sections as I found most of it relatively irrelevant and skipped to the parts where they
told us how to program.

What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
(Not including course materials)
I googled on how to create and if statement in MIPS because the readings didn't really explain
how they worked.

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
No, I merely asked one of my friends whether or not my pseudo code in the beginning was ok.
