-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
I learnt how to use MultiMedia Logic to create several logic gates when given a truth table. I also learn that it is possible to match a truth table using only NAND and NOR gates.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
There weren't any major issues with the lab. One small issue was that I didn't know how to use the application, the videos didn't help that much but I asked a friend and he showed it to me and I quickly understood it

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think the problems assigned for the lab were fine. However, I do think some improvement to the tutorials can be made because me and my friends all had a few issues with how the application worked.

What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
I had trouble with the second part of Part C so I googled to see if there was a way to create and inverter with only NAND gates, which is that I used in order to complete the lab.

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
Yes, the only form of collaboration I had was asking some of my friends how the application worked and how to create curcuits using the applicaiton.
