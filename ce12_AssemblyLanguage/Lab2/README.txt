What did you learn in this lab?
I learnt how create and adder, mux and comparator with just using the regular logic gates. I also learnt a lot more
and got a lot of practice working with 2's complement.

what worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Everything worked fine overall. However, I did have some issues with creating the registers.
also the overflow and the cheat LED would every now and then show an error but would work fine again if I were to 
stop the simulation and start it.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think that the lab was designed fine. Although I feel it might have been miss timed because a lot of people were
confused where to start and weren't sure what to do because we hadn't learnt 2's complement which scared a lot of
people initially

What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
I googled the formmating of an adder and a comparator so that I could use it for the lab.

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe level of collaboration.
Yes. However, the only thing we collaborated on were a few concepts of the function part of the lab and
debugging errors.
