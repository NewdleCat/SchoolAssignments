\begin{proof}
First let us show that the operation is bilinear by showing that $[mA +B, z] = [mA,C] + [mB,c]$ such that $a,b,c \in \R^3$, recall that
\[
	x = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ x_j \\ x_k  \end{bmatrix}
	y = \begin{bmatrix} y_i \\ y_j \\ y_k  \end{bmatrix}
	z = \begin{bmatrix} z_i \\ z_j \\ z_k  \end{bmatrix}
	x \times y = \begin{bmatrix} x_jy_k - x_ky_j \\ x_ky_i - x_i y_k \\ x_iy_j - x_jy_i  \end{bmatrix}
\]
Now for some scalar $m$ we have
\[
	[mx +B, z]= 
	\begin{bmatrix} mx_i + y_i \\ mx_j + y_j \\ mx_k + y_k  \end{bmatrix} \times
	\begin{bmatrix} z_i \\ z_j \\ z_k  \end{bmatrix}
	= \begin{bmatrix} (mx_j+y_j)z_k - (mx_k+y_k)z_j \\ (mx_k+y_k)z_i - (mx_i+y_i)z_k \\ (mx_i+y_i)z_j - (mx_j+y_j)z_i  \end{bmatrix}
\]
\begin{align*}
[mx,z] + [mB,z] &= \begin{bmatrix} mx_i \\ mx_j \\ mx_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} z_i \\ z_j \\ z_k  \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} y_i \\ y_j \\ y_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} z_i \\ z_j \\ z_k  \end{bmatrix} \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} mx_jz_k - mx_kz_j \\ mx_kz_i-mx_iz_k \\ mx_iz_j - mx_jz_i  \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} y_jz_k-y_kz_j \\ y_kz_i - y_iz_k \\ y_iz_j - y_jz_i \end{bmatrix} 
=\begin{bmatrix} (mx_j+y_j)z_k - (mx_k+y_k)z_j \\ (mx_k+y_k)z_i - (mx_i+y_i)z_k \\ (mx_i+y_i)z_j - (mx_j+y_j)z_i  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Next, to show Alternativity for this algebra, we need to show that $[x, x] = 0$
\[
	x = \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ x_j \\ x_k  \end{bmatrix} \text{Then we have } [x, x] = x \times x = \begin{bmatrix} x_jx_k-x_kx_j \\ x_kx_i-x_ix_k \\ x_ix_j-x_jx_i  \end{bmatrix} = 0
\]

Finally, lets us show that this algebra satisfies the Jacobi identity
\[
[x, [y,z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0
\]
\[
\begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ x_j \\ x_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \left( \begin{bmatrix} y_i \\ y_j \\ y_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} z_i \\ z_j \\ z_k  \end{bmatrix} \right) + \begin{bmatrix} y_i \\ y_j \\ y_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \left( \begin{bmatrix} z_i \\ z_j \\ z_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ x_j \\ x_k  \end{bmatrix} \right)+ \begin{bmatrix} z_i \\ z_j \\ z_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \left( \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ x_j \\ x_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} y_i \\ y_j \\ y_k  \end{bmatrix} \right)
\]
\[
= \begin{bmatrix} x_i \\ x_j \\ x_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \left( \begin{bmatrix} y_jz_k-y_kz_j \\ y_kz_i-y_iz_k \\ y_iz_j-y_jz_i  \end{bmatrix} \right) +
\begin{bmatrix} y_i \\ y_j \\ y_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \left( \begin{bmatrix} z_jx_k-z_kx_j \\ z_kx_i-z_ix_k \\ z_ix_j-z_jx_i  \end{bmatrix} \right) +
\begin{bmatrix} z_i \\ z_j \\ z_k  \end{bmatrix} \times \left( \begin{bmatrix} x_jy_k-x_ky_j \\ x_ky_i-x_iy_k \\ x_iy_j-x_jy_i  \end{bmatrix} \right)
\]
\[
=\begin{bmatrix} x_j(y_iz_j-y_jz_i)-x_k(y_kz_i-y_iz_k) \\ x_k(y_jz_k-y_kz_j)-x_i(y_iz_j-y_jz_i) \\ x_i(y_kz_i-y_iz_k)-x_j(y_jz_k-y_kz_j)  \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix} y_j(z_ix_j-z_jx_i)-y_k(z_kx_i-z_ix_k) \\ y_k(z_jx_k-z_kx_j)-y_i(z_ix_j-z_jx_i) \\ y_i(z_kx_i-z_ix_k)-y_j(z_jx_k-z_kx_j)  \end{bmatrix} 
\]
\[+\begin{bmatrix} z_j(x_iy_j-x_jy_i)-z_k(x_ky_i-x_iy_k) \\ z_k(x_jy_k-x_ky_j)-z_i(x_iy_j-x_jy_i) \\ z_i(x_ky_i-x_iy_k)-z_j(x_jy_k-x_ky_j)  \end{bmatrix} = 0\]
After expanding and adding all three matrices, all the terms should cancel out. Thus the jacobi identity for the cross product on vectors of $\R^3$ is proven. This makes it a Lie algebra
\end{proof}






\section{Lie Groups}
\begin{definition}
Let $G$ be a set with two main properties. \\
  i) $G$ is first and foremost a group\\
  ii) $G$ is a smooth manifold. \\
  if $G$ satisfies these two properties, it is considered a Lie group.
\end{definition}	
\begin{rem}
I will not be delving too much into manifolds, but a light understanding of what they are helps. A manifold is a topological space that resembles euclidean space. Essentially, you take a geometric object of some dimension $n$ and try to fit it into a space that is dimension $k$ such that $n > k$. Take the image below as an example. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{circ.png}
\end{figure}
If we take a circle, which is a 2-dimensional object, and zoom in and look at an arbitrarily small segment of the circle, it will look 1-dimensional. An intuitive example might be the Earth, we know that it is in fact round, however from our small perspective, it seems flat. For a manifold to be smooth, it means that for each point in the manifold, there is a tangent space.
\end{rem}
Adding to the idea of manifolds each Lie group has a corresponding Lie algebra that acts as its tangent space of the identity element in the group.
\begin{ex}
An easy example of a Lie group are the real numbers $\R$ under multiplication.
\end{ex}

\subsection{Properties of Lie Groups}
\begin{defn}
Given two Lie groups $G$ and $H$, we can have a homomorphism of Lie groups given some map between the groups $f: G \rightarrow H$ and a map between the two manifolds(since Lie groups are both). This map can also be homomorphic and isomorphic
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
For some Lie group $G$, for every $a \in G$ there exists a map:
\[ L_a: G \rightarrow G \text{ and } L_a(b) = ab\]
We call this a \textbf{left translation}. Similarly, for all $b \in G$ there exists a map:
\[ R_a: G \rightarrow G \text{ and } R_a(b) = ba\]
This is called a \textbf{right translation}
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
For some group $(G, \cdot)$ if for $x,y \in G$ and $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$ then the group is known to be \textbf{abelian}
\end{defn}


Now lets use this lie group as an example to understand the relationship
between lie groups and lie algebras
SO(n) or also known as the Special orthogonal group is the group of rotation
matrices around a single point, so So(2) would represent the rotations around
a unit circle, whilst So(3) would be rotations for a unit sphere
and small so(n) is its corresponding liue algbera

So how do we use it? well for groups like So(n) its kind of hard to visualize
since its a bunch of transormations especially for higher dimensions. 
Well with the power of lie algebras we can linearize them. So lets use 
SO(2) as an example, we can see the circle in the middle representing
So(2), then all the lines around it would represent the elements
of little so(2), its lie algebra. 

Another neat little trick that we can use lie algebras for is the exponential map
What this map does is it takes elemetns from the lie algebra, and maps them into
the lie gorup. So we can take those tangent vectors, and essentially turn them 
into elements that exist within the lie group. 

In terms of matrix groups and algebrs, the exponential map would simply be the
matrix exponential.

Now this image doesn't exactly show that happening with the exponential map, but
I thought that it was a good representation of what is sort of happending. You can see
the tangent vector slowly converging towards the curve, and thats exactly what is
happenening between the lie algerbra and lie group elements.
